			<h1>BackStories</h1>

				<h2> Main Game </h2>
 

					<h2>Noah</h2>

						<p> Noah has always been told not to go into the woods surronding the Village of Wilberry that he grew up in. <br>
						But he sees a brown and white dog that he thinks could be a stray dog and decides he should run after it to try and catch it. <br> 
						But he gets turned around and starts to find notes from previous kids of the village that went missing.<br>
						That says he can't escape the woods until they find out what is going on and puts a stop to it</p> 

					<h2>Dylan</h2>

						<p> Dylan is one of the previous missing kids from the Village and he used to be Noah's childhood bestfriend. <br> 
						He left his diary entries around the sewers and by doing this he hopes somone will find him. <br>
						He can help the player by helping them understand the differnt Enemies in the area, he will tell them where they have hideouts, and the routes they go to get around.</p>

					<h2> Maisy </h2>

						<p> Maisy is another previous missing kid from the village. Maisy has left </p>



					<h2> Cody </h2>

						<p> Cody used to be a very loved pet, he was owned by the mistress of the mansion in the middle of the forest but when the mistress
						passed away Cody found himself lost and confused about where his beloved owner had gone so he stays around the mansion just in case she may 
						return. For fun he likes to trick anyone in the forest and lie to them about things. </p>

					<h2> Chipmunk </h2>
						<p> Chipmunk was the runt of his litter and was left to die but he was found by a white westie called Cody. Cody helped raise him, and they have
						worked together to keep people form going missing in the forest ever since but its not that easier. Unlike Cody Chipmunk leads anyone in the forest
						to clues so that they can stop this from happening. </p>

					<h2> Ethan </h2>
						<p> Ethan was the son of the mistress living in the mansion, His childhood was really bad as all his mom ever talked about was the fact,
						he wasn’t perfect like his sister. Ethan hated that and he turned on his sister and his mom kicked him out of the house because she was so 
						annoyed. From then on he has set out to make everyone that enters the forest perfect to put his mind into theirs so he can please his mom. </p>

					<h2> Flint </h2>
						<p> Flint used to be a stray dog that had escaped from a puppy farm. Ethan saw the potential of having a dog and gained Flints trust 
						and over the years Flint has learned to help Ethan  with any tasks that are needed. Flint really hates it sometimes he doesn’t get fed 
						very much and is always hit if he doesn’t do the task correctly. He has nowhere else to go though as Ethan would find him no matter what or where he goes. </p>

					<h2> Dolls </h2>
						<p> The Dolls used to be ordinary dolls, that Ethan used to steal from his sister before he got kicked out, he made them alive to be able to help him
						and they have become like his puppets. Some of them have even been rumoured to have trapped souls of the missing kids that Ethan deemed not perfect enough
						for his master plan.  </p>
